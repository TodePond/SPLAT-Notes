# SPLAT Notes
My personal notes and docs for the SPLAT language.

# Introduction
todo: What is SPLAT?

# Installation
todo: Improve this section<br>
I followed this [quick start script](https://github.com/striderssoftware/T2SplatCode/blob/e41d2af8c4cb4ed4f6da239d93863560cff5ef97/Docs/quickStartScript).<br>
Some things didn't go smoothly, so I used these [notes](https://github.com/striderssoftware/T2SplatCode/blob/e41d2af8c4cb4ed4f6da239d93863560cff5ef97/Docs/notes.txt#L67) to help me through.

# File Structure
I made a new folder in `SPLAT/demos` named whatever I want.<br>
I copied and pasted the [MakeFile file](https://github.com/DaveAckley/SPLAT/blob/develop/demos/FB/Makefile) from another demo into my folder.<br>
I wrote my code in various `.splat` files, named whatever I want.<br>
To try out my code, I write `make` in the terminal in this folder.<br>
This also makes a `.mfz` file in my folder. I can run this file directly with the `mfzrun` command.
