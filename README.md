# SPLAT Notes
My personal notes and docs for the SPLAT language.

# Introduction
todo: What is SPLAT?

# Installation

# File Structure
I made a new folder in `SPLAT/demos` named whatever I want.<br>
I copied and pasted the [MakeFile file]() from another demo into my folder.<br>
I wrote my code in various `.splat` files, named whatever I want.<br>
To try out my code, I write `make` in the terminal in this folder.<br>
This also makes a `.mfz` file in my folder. I can run this file directly with the `mfzrun` command.
